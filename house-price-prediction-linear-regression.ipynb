It compares the difference between individual points in our data set and the predicted best fit line to measure the amount of error produced.\n\nIn order to interpret this summary and to get an overview of the statistics here, we need to know the components in the table. I will try to explain the most important ones in my opinion.\n\nTypically when using statsmodels we have three main tables. The table called the model summary, which is at the top of the summary, contains information that is mostly known to us; such as **dependent variable, model, method, date and time we created the model, number of observations.\n\n**DF Residuals** is widely used in many contexts throughout statistics, including hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and regression analysis. It is represents the degrees of freedom of our model, the formula is given below.\n'(number of observations) - (number of predicting variables - 1)'<br>\n'(n-k-1 = 4600-11-1 = 4588)'. <br>\n\n\n**R-squared** is one of the most important explanatory power, a measure of how much of the independent variable is explained by changes in our dependent variables. R-squared 0 means our regression explains NONE of the variabilty of the data, while R-sguared equal 1 means it explains the entire variability. In our case, the model can only explain 21% of our dataset.\n\nChecking the **adjusted R-squared** is essential to analyze the effectiveness of multiple dependent variables on the model. Excessive use of variables is penalized when measuring, so while adding some variables that don't contribute to our model can increase our R-square, it often has a negative impact on the adjusted R-squared. It is always smaller than R squared.\n\nIn the second part of our summary, the table of coefficients, I want to focus on the coefficients of the **intercept** (the constant, they can be used interchangeably) first. This component expresses the biases of our model.(b0, b1 etc.) For each variable, it is the measure of how the change in that variable affects the independent one.\n\n**The standard error**, indicates the accuracy of our prediction for each variable. Lower the standard error better the estimate :)\n\nThere are also other values called **t statistics and its P-value**. The null hypothesis in this test is H0: B=0 (Is the coefficient equal to zero?) *P-value < 0.05 means that the variable is significant. 0.000 shows us size is a significant variable when predicting house prices!\n\nAs can be clearly seen from the explanations I have made so far, our model needs improvements. Let's start working on it!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dealing with missing values\n\nThere is no NaN value in our data set, but it would be good to check 0's or 999's for the sake of data consistency. I don't see any irrelevant max values in the describe output but there are some zeros to check.\n\nWe have to deal with 49 houses that look free, plus 2 houses each without a bedroom and a bathroom. Since they are few in number, we can remove these values directly from our data set, but since I want to try a few different methods, I will try to keep them by replacing them with appropriate values.\n\nI will leave waterfront as it is because zero values indicate there is no \"waterfront\" rather than the information being unknown.

Fortunately, python tools of pandas and scikit-learn provide several approaches that can be implemented. \n\nHere some methods that can be used:\n\n**One-Hot Encoding**\nOne-Hot Encoding gets each group of any categorical variable a new variable by mapping each group to binary numbers (0 or 1). Used when data is nominal. Newly created binary properties can be considered as dummy variables.<br>\n**Dummy Encoding**\nThe Dummy encoding scheme is similar to one-hot encoding. In the case of one-hot encoding, it uses N binary variables for N categories in a variable. Dummy encoding is a minor improvement over one-hot encoding, it uses N-1 properties to represent N tags/categories.<br>\n**Effect Encoding**\nWhen applying this encoding type, the categories are given values in the format -1,0,1. The -1 occurrence is the only difference between One-Hot encoding and effects encoding.<br>\n**Label Encoding or Ordinal Encoding**\nThis type of encoding is used when the variables in the data are ordinal.

To fix: Run a non-linear regression, exponential transformation, log transformation\n\n**2)No Endogeneity:** Omitted variable bias occurs when we forget to include a variable. This is reflected in the error term as the factor you forgot about is included in the error. In this way, the error is not random but includes a systematic part (the omitted variable).\n\n**3)Normality and Homoscedasticy:** We have assumed that the errors have normal distribution, Zero Mean: Having an intercept solves that problem, in real life it is unusual to having that problem. Homoscedasticity: It means to having equal variance. To fix: Look for OVB, Look for outliers, Apply log transformation\n\n**4)No Autocorrelation(no serial correlation):** Durbin Watson score falls between zero and four. <1 and >3 cause an alarm, if we detect the problem, we need to use alternative method.\n\n**5)No Multicollinearity:** Independent variables that effect each others.
